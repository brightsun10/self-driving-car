# 🧠🚗 Self-Driving Car Simulator (Three.js + Brain.js)

This is an interactive simulation of a self-driving car built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for 3D rendering and [Brain.js](https://brain.js.org/) for neural network-based AI control.

## 🌐 Demo

👉 Try the live simulation on Hugging Face Spaces:  
**[🚀 Launch Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/your-username/self-driving-car)**

> ⚠️ Replace `your-username` with your actual Hugging Face username after deploying.

## 🕹️ How It Works

1. **Manual Drive**  
   Use ← and → arrow keys to manually steer the car.

2. **Data Collection**  
   Click `Start Recording` to collect training data using the car’s sensor distances and your steering inputs.

3. **Train AI**  
   Click `Train AI` to train a neural network using [Brain.js](https://github.com/BrainJS/brain.js) (in-browser).

4. **Autonomous Mode**  
   Click `Start Self-Driving` to activate AI control.
